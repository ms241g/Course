Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Manoj Sharma
Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique for resolving complex problems by recursively breaking them up into sub-problems, 
which are then each solved individually. 
Dynamic programming optimizes recursive programming and saves us the time of re-computing inputs later.
